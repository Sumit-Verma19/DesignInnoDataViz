Installation

To get started with this project, you need Python installed. Then, follow the steps below to install the required packages.

1. Clone the Repository

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/project-data-visualization.git
   cd project-data-visualization
   ```

2. Set Up a Virtual Environment

   It's recommended to use a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install Required Packages**

   Install the required packages using the `requirements.txt` file:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   Ensure the `requirements.txt` includes:

   ```plaintext
   numpy
   pandas
   matplotlib
   seaborn
   panel
   bokeh
   ```

Usage

1. Prepare Your Data

   Ensure your `projects_data.csv` file is in the project directory. This file should contain relevant columns such as `Design Efficiency`, `Innovation Score`, `Cost Efficiency (%)`, and other relevant metrics.

2. Run the Panel Dashboard

   Start the dashboard using Panel:

   ```bash
   panel serve dashboard.py --show
   ```

   Replace `dashboard.py` with your script's filename.

3. Interact with the Dashboard

   A browser window will open with the interactive dashboard. Use the dropdown menus to select and explore different visualizations focusing on Design Efficiency and Innovation.

Features

- Design Efficiency Analysis**: Visualize key metrics that affect design efficiency, such as project type, complexity levels, and software used.
- Innovation Score Analysis**: Explore how various factors like team size, design phase duration, and neighborhood influence innovation.
- Comparative Analysis**: Use scatter plots, joint plots, and heatmaps to compare design efficiency against innovation scores, cost efficiency, and client feedback.
- Interactive Controls**: Easily switch between different visualization categories and specific graphs for detailed analysis.

Data Overview

- Design Efficiency: Measures how effectively design resources are utilized. Key metrics include `Design Phase Duration (weeks)` and `Cost Efficiency (%)`.
- Innovation: Evaluates the novelty and creativity in project execution. Key metrics include `Innovation Score`, `Sustainability Index`, and `Innovation per Revision`.
- Other Metrics: `Client Feedback Score`, `Team Size`, and `Design Software Used` help provide a holistic view of project performance.
